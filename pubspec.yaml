description: Bi VPN is a mobile application that provides a secure and private connection to the internet. It is designed to protect your online activity from prying eyes and keep your data safe from hackers and cybercriminals.  The app allows you to connect to a virtual private network (VPN) server in a different location, which encrypts your internet traffic and hides your IP address. This means that your online activity is invisible to anyone who may be monitoring it, including your internet service provider, advertisers, or government agencies.  With Bi VPN, you can access websites and online services that may be restricted in your location due to censorship or geo-blocking. You can also use the app to bypass internet throttling, which is when your internet speed is intentionally slowed down by your ISP.  The app is user-friendly and easy to use, with a simple interface that allows you to connect to a VPN server with just one tap. It also offers a variety of VPN protocols to choose from, including OpenVPN, IKEv2, and L2TP/IPSec.  In addition to providing security and privacy, Bi VPN also offers fast connection speeds, which ensures that your online activities are not slowed down by the VPN connection.  Overall, Bi VPN is a reliable and efficient mobile application that provides a secure and private connection to the internet. Whether you want to protect your online activity from prying eyes or access restricted websites and online services, this app has you covered.
